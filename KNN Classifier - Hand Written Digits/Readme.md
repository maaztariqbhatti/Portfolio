About the dataset:

• The task at hand is to develop a classification model for hand-written digits {0, 1, ..., 9}.
• Leap Motion Sensor was used for this purpose and the 3-D location data generated
is used in this problem. (Dataset was not generated by me)

Other files:

•	The “main” file contains code with preprocessing, random data division into testing and training and the running of knn algorithm. The function “knn” is used in the main function which operates on multiple testing data.

•	The mat file of data contains the time series dataset of 1000 samples of hand written digits in a 3D space

•	“DTW” contains code for the algorithm of Dynamic Time Wrapping i.e distance calculation between two time series
