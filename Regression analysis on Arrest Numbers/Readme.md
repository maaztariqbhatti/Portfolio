The objective is to use machine learning techniques, in our case linear regression, to determine which factors affect and are related to the number of murder based arrests. We will make use of the R programming language as our analytical tool. In order to make sense of our data we will use different visualizations. Different libraries will be used in order to implement linear regression, plot correlations and perform other tasks for our analytical analysis. By the end we will obtain a linear model that will be able to predict murder arrests in relation to its significant explanatory variables. We will also make sure that the properties for linear regression using OLS are linked to the residuals of the linear regression model. Lastly, we will take a look at how the insights gathered from this analysis can be put to practical use and benefit the police.
