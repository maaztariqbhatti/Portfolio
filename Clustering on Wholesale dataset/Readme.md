We will be performing clustering analysis using “wholesale” dataset. The dataset contains annual spending’s of client's in different categories of goods. The aim is to partition the data using K means clustering into groups. The output of our analysis will group clients into different clusters with each cluster representing a unique quality

This folder contains the following artifacts:
- R file that contains the code regarding Clustering using K means algorithm, pre processing, techniques to determine optimal number of clusters.
- PDF document that contains a detailed report on techniques used to perform clustering (Pre-processing, Clustering Algorithm, Exploratory data analysis) along with the results
- Dataset file "wholesale_Mac" for Mac OS
- Dataset file "wholesale" for Windows
